TODO:

Misc:
- weaveate benchmarks speed and accuracy seperatly. consider this


Databases:
- look into the following
    - SIFT1M
    - Glove-25 and 100
    - Deep image 96
    - GIST 960
- get proof of random vectors being slower for HNSW

Models:
- look into which models to benchmark
- implement filtering as well
- think about distance measure. sometimes they use angular, sometimes L2
- implement wrapper for faiss such that it can be passed vectors. It's wierd to build before hand.

Metrics:
- implment p-99 and p-x latency. maybe get the whole distribution
- recall@1, recall@10, recall@k
- maybe use GCP as benchmarking platform
- use python timeit to avoid garbage collection etc.?
